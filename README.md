# ZENO Mixer

ZENO Mixer is a non-custodial privacy tool built on Solana’s decentralized infrastructure. It ensures privacy for users by exploiting Solana’s speed while preserving anonymity using zk-STARKs and optimized CoinJoin.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-Focused**: Utilizes zk-STARKs and CoinJoin for privacy and speed.
- **No Admin Controls**: Fully autonomous smart contracts.
- **Gasless Withdrawals**: Relayer network pays fees (0.1% bonus fee).
- **Cross-Zeno Liquidity Swaps**: Prevents chain analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Deposit**: Users deposit SOL/SPL tokens into fragmented liquidity pools (Zeno Pools).
2. **Mixing**: The mixer performs zk-shuffling and cross-pool liquidity swaps.
3. **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw via stealth addresses or fresh wallets.
